A very basic (no ffmpeg included) docker wrapper around [[https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp][yt-dlp]]

* Build

Assuming =%ARCH%= is either =arm= or =x86=:

#+begin_example
  docker build -f %ARCH%/Dockerfile -t yt-dlp .
#+end_example

* Run wrapper

/Notice/: Replace =%DIR%= with asbolute path to download videos into.

=/usr/local/bin/yt-dlp.docker=:

#+begin_example
  #!/bin/sh

  dest=%DIR%
  exec docker run -it --rm --init -v "$dest":/workdir yt-dlp --no-cache-dir "$@"
#+end_example

By default it runs as =1000:1000= (uid:gid). Evidently, the user
should have write perms on the destination dir. Custom uid:gid can be
supplied with ~--user=uid:gid~ option in the wrapper above.

* Usage

Much like the vanilla =yt-dlp=. For example download some youtube
video in format =18= (360p mp4):

#+begin_example
  yt-dlp.docker -f 18 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKlLYfQcu9o'
#+end_example

=sudo= might be required in case the running user is not allowed to
use docker. For example in Ubuntu a user should be added to the
=docker= group to use docker.
